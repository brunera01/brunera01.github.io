    <p>Hi, my name is Alan Bruner. I am currently a second-year
      student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. By credits I
      am a junior and I plane on graduating in the Spring of 2022. I have
      taken numerous classes relating to a wide variety of areas within computer science, ranging from. My skills
      include programming in Java and SQL, using GIT to manage projects, and creating software
      requirements and specifications.</p>
    <p> During High School I worked at a local grocery store and completed classes at Illinois Valley Community
      College outside of the normal school day. I participated in Operation Catapult at Rose-Hulman during
      the summer of 2018, where I received hands-on experience working on a project from start to finish. I
      successfully completed the Rose-Hulman “Accelerated Math and Physics” program, where I received
      credit for Calculus 3, Physics 1, and Physics 2 during an intense summer program prior to my freshman
      year at Rose. During my first year at Rose, I participated in a work-study program with the Instructional
      Technology Department, where I assisted students and faculty by providing and setting up educational
      equipment. Currently, I serve as the Academic chair at the Rose-Hulman chapter of the Lambda Chi
      Alpha Fraternity.</p>
